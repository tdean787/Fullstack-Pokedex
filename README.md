### PokeDex created with ReactJS

This is a work in progress project intended to build familiarity with React and it's various features.

#### Some TODOS:
~~Implement routing functionality. Click a displayed pokemon/result and go into a more detailed page/component ~~

Add different database features e.g. favoriting pokemon, creating a team 

 ~~Add a filter search method based on stats, type, etc.~~
 
 
Add more styling 

Implement the data for pokemon that the selected evolves to. Complications with API endpoint and resulting data in the evolution chain 


The project is currently hosted on Netlify until no longer suitable.
