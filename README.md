### PokeDex created with ReactJS

This is a work in progress project intended to build familiarity with React and it's various features.

#### Some TODOS:


Add different database features e.g. favoriting pokemon, creating a team 
 
Style app further

Implement the data/display for pokemon that the selected evolves to. Complications with API endpoint and resulting data in the evolution chain 

 ~~Add a filter search method based on stats, type, etc.~~
 
 ~~Implement routing functionality. Click a displayed pokemon/result and go into a more detailed page/component~~

The project is currently hosted on Netlify
